					<h3>It all started when...</h3>
					<p>I began making soaps in the summer of 2013. Having a lifetime of sensitive skin I was always on
						the look out for kinder skincare products. At the time there were very few products available
						that were free from sodium lauryl sulphate, plastic packaging and ingredients not tested on
						animals. Being keen to learn how to craft things myself, I embarked on my first journey into
						soapmaking. My very first scent was inspired by a popular drink served in the restaurant I
						worked at - lime and lemongrass (a scent still requested to this day!) </p>
					<p>The first batch was.... interesting. Having got excited to gather the ingredients, I neglected to
						properly look at the recipe, nor think about the molds I was going to use. With a huge (3kg!)
						quantity of soap batter ready to go, I scrambled to find anything I could use - old tupperware,
						empty washing up bottles, cardboard boxes, you name it. I also wasn't aware that it's not the
						best idea to put fresh ingredients into soap. I ended up with 3kg of blackened, gooey mess that
						smelt wonderful and most importantly - cleaned my hands!</p>

					<p>From there the <del>addiction</del> hobby was born. I researched more on suitable ingredients,
						perfected recipes, played around with perfumery and eventually ended up with a lot of soap!
						These made fantastic gifts, but I had more than I could give away. It was time to start selling!
					</p>
					<p>I created a name for myself <em>Coeden Noeth</em> (Welsh for <em>bare tree</em>) and got some of
						my favourite recipes certified, eventually becoming a regular (and popular!) feature at Anglesey
						Farmers' Market, Beaumaris Market, Bangor Christmas market, Llangefni Craft Fair, and other
						bespoke events.</p>

					<p>On one particularly busy Bangor University student christmas market, I was approached by
						the curator of Treborth Botanic Gardens with the opportunity to set up shop there. The
						popularity of the soaps there led to us to begin working on a soapmaking workshop to be hosted
						at
						the gardens. Initial funding came from <a href="https://botanicgarden.wales/"><strong>National
								Botanic Gardens Wales</strong></a> and further support from <a
							href="https://www.friendsoftreborthbotanicgarden.org/"><strong>Friends of Treborth Botanic
								Gardens</strong></a>. </p>
					<p>A trial run of a soapmaking workshop was run with friends and family, where incredibly
						imaginative and somewhat questionable scents such as "Toxic Masculinity" and "Bearded Baby" were
						created! After feedback from this session, we then opened them up to the public. I then also realised I much preferred teaching over selling, and thanks to the huge popularity of these workshops, I began focussing my efforts on encouraging others to get creative (while still occasionally selling some products at the Treborth plant sales)</p>
